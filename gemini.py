  Operating the Climate Control System  Your Googlecar has a climate control
  system that allows you to adjust the temperature and airflow in the car.
  To operate the climate control system, use the buttons and knobs located on
  the center console.  Temperature: The temperature knob controls the
  temperature inside the car. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the
  temperature or counterclockwise to decrease the temperature.
  Airflow: The airflow knob controls the amount of airflow inside the car.
  Turn the knob clockwise to increase the airflow or counterclockwise to
  decrease the airflow. Fan speed: The fan speed knob controls the speed
  of the fan. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the fan speed or
  counterclockwise to decrease the fan speed.
  Mode: The mode button allows you to select the desired mode. The available
  modes are: Auto: The car will automatically adjust the temperature and
  airflow to maintain a comfortable level.
  Cool: The car will blow cool air into the car.
  Heat: The car will blow warm air into the car.
  Defrost: The car will blow warm air onto the windshield to defrost it.
